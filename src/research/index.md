## Research

I am currently in the second year of my PhD in the group of [Prof Judith Mank](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mank-group/) at [University College London](http://ucl.ac.uk). My work is at the interface of evolutionary biology and bioinformatics and I try to find computational solutions in order to answer evolutionary questions. I have a strong background in computational biology and am able to develop in [Python](http://www.python.org/), [R](http://www.r-project.org/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and a bit of C++, and I work mainly under various flavors of [Linux](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/).

My research focuses on the following aspects:

### The Evolution of Gene Expression
-------------------

Understanding how gene expression evolves and how selective pressures on the phenotype shape the evolution of gene expression is a major question in evolutionary biology. Even between very closely related species we observe an astonishing amount of phenotypic variation. This variation is partly the result of differences in gene content, such as through mutations in protein coding genes, but also the result of differences in gene expression. The genome is not static - each cell in a multi-cellular organism expresses genes differently, depending on tissue type, sex or environmental factors. In my research I try to understand how gene expression evolves within and between species.

### The Evolution of Sex Chromosomes
-------------------

Most non-biologists are only aware of the XY chromosome system present in mammals (yes, that includes us humans!). In the XY system females carry two copies of the X chromosome, the homogametic sex, whereas males carry one X copy and one Y copy and are therefore called the heterogametic sex. However, multiple other sex chromosome systems evolved independently in the plant and animal kingdom, such as the ZW system in birds or the UV system in mosses.

In my research I try to understand how sex chromosomes have evolved in general and, more specifically, how dosage compensation mechanisms evolved in order to balance gene expression differences between males and females.

### Genome and Gene Family Evolution
-------------------

The availability of high-throughput DNA and RNA sequences makes it possible to study the evolution of single genes and whole genomes on an unprecedented scale. The current release of the [Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org/) database contains ~70 species, with a strong focus on vertebrates and model organisms; however, the Genomes Online Database counts a total of around ~19000 completed genome projects ([source](http://genomesonline.org/cgi-bin/GOLD/index.cgi?page_requested=Complete+Genome+Projects)) and another ~21000 genomes currently being sequenced. 

In my research I combine genomics tools like ortholog/paralogy detection, synteny detection and molecular sequence evolution with gene expression data in order to reconstruct gene families in a phylogenetic context and understand how single-gene and whole-genome duplications impact the evolution of gene expression.
