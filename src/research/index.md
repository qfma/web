## Research
In my research at the [Mankgroup](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mank-group/) I am using computational methods to understand different aspects of evolutionary biology. I am particularly interested in the following aspects:

### The Evolution of Gene Expression
-------------------
### The Evolution of Sex Chromosomes
-------------------
### From Genotype to Phenotype
-------------------
### Genome and Gene Family Evolution
