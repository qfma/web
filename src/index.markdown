#### I am Fabian Zimmer, a computational biologist. 

#### Currently, I am doing my PhD in the group of [Judith Mank](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mank-group/) at the University College London. I am mainly interested in understanding the evolution of gene expression, the evolution of sex chromosomes, linking genotype and phenotype and the evolution of gene families.
